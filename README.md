# inspection-reminder

This project uses a NodeMCU ESP8266 and a DFPlayer Mini to help standardize and validate the production inspection process. The system provides automatic audio reminders during the inspection process.

‚ú® Features
- Audio reminder playback using the DFPlayer Mini
- Volume, play, and stop control via the NodeMCU web server
- Customizable audio sequence, volume, and delays for inspection needs in 20 different recipe
- A simple web interface with level password (can be further developed)

üõ†Ô∏è Hardware
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- DFPlayer Mini + Speaker or Active Speaker
- MicroSD Card (containing MP3 audio files)
- 5V Power Supply

üíª Software & Libraries
Arduino IDE
Required libraries to install:
- DFRobotDFPlayerMini
- ESP8266WiFi
- ESP8266WebServer
- EEPROM
- SoftwareSerial

‚úÖ How it Works
1. When powered on, plays the last recipe before shutdown
2. Plays Track 001 through Track 004 with a delay between tracks
3. Tracks 005 and 006 are for breaks and will play when the delay interval is reached
4. After finishing Track 006, it will return to step 2
